# PacWord

> Pac-Man is a maze action game developed and released by Namco for arcades in 1980. The player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called "Power Pellets" causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.

Pac-Word is a recreation of the retro Pac-Man with letters instead of pellets being the main focus. To gain the most points, the player as Pac-Man must collect all letters of the word in the correct order while avoiding ghosts.

In the "PacWord" folder run the PacWord.exe file to run.
